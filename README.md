# Heart_Disease_classification

This is one of the projects I completed in the Complete A.I. & Machine Learning, Data Science Bootcamp course. The notebook in this project explores the use of various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries to build a model capable of predicting whether someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes (Classification problem).
